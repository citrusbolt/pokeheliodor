/* This file handles the generation of rtl code from tree structure
   above the level of expressions, using subroutines in exp*.c and emit-rtl.c.
   It also creates the rtl expressions for parameters and auto variables
   and has full responsibility for allocating stack slots.

   The functions whose names start with `expand_' are called by the
   parser to generate RTL instructions for various kinds of constructs.

   Some control and binding constructs require calling several such
   functions at different times.  For example, a simple if-then
   is expanded by calling `expand_start_cond' (with the condition-expression
   as argument) before parsing the then-clause and calling `expand_end_cond'
   after parsing the then-clause.  */

   An AVL tree of case nodes is initially created, and later transformed
   to a list linked via the RIGHT fields in the nodes.  Nodes with
   higher case values are later in the list.

   Switch statements can be output in one of two forms.  A branch table
   is used if there are more than a few labels and the labels are dense
   within the range between the smallest and largest case value.  If a
   branch table is used, no further manipulations are done with the case
   node chain.

   The alternative to the use of a branch table is to generate a series
   of compare and jump insns.  When that is done, we use the LEFT, RIGHT,
   and PARENT fields to hold a binary tree.  Initially the tree is
   totally unbalanced, with everything on the right.  We balance the tree

/* Stack of control and binding constructs we are currently inside.

   These constructs begin when you call `expand_start_WHATEVER'
   and end when you call `expand_end_WHATEVER'.  This stack records
   info about how the construct began that tells the end-function
   what to do.  It also may provide information about the construct
   to alter the behavior of other constructs within the body.
   For example, they may affect the behavior of C `break' and `continue'.

   Each construct gets one `struct nesting' object.
   All of these objects are chained through the `all' field.
   `nesting_stack' points to the first object (innermost construct).
   The position of an entry on `nesting_stack' is in its `depth' field.

   Each type of construct has its own individual stack.
   For example, loops have `loop_stack'.  Each object points to the
   next object of the same type through the `next' field.

   Some constructs are visible to `break' exit-statements and others
   are not.  Which constructs are visible depends on the language.
   Therefore, the data structure allows each construct to be visible
   or not, according to the args given when the construct is started.
   The construct is visible if the `exit_label' field is non-null.

   The thus generated decision tree follows the form of the

   INDEX_TYPE is the type of the index of the switch.

   Care is taken to prune redundant tests from the decision tree
   by detecting any boundary conditions already checked by
   emitted rtx.  (See node_has_high_bound, node_has_low_bound
   and node_is_bounded, above.)

   Where the test conditions can be shown to be redundant we emit
   an unconditional jump to the target code.  As a further
   optimization, the subordinates of a tree node are examined to
   check for bounded nodes.  In this case conditional and/or
   unconditional jumps as a result of the boundary check for the
   current node are arranged to target the subordinates associated
   code for out of bound conditions on the current node.

   We can assume that when control reaches the code generated here,
   the index value has already been compared with the parents
   of this node, and determined to be on the same side of each parent
   as this node is.  Thus, if this node tests for the value 51,
   and a parent tested for 52, we don't need to consider
   the possibility of a value greater than 51.  If another parent
   tests for the value 50, then this node need not test anything.  */
